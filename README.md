# Sequelize Eat-Da-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.  Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
